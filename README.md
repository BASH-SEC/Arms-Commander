# Arms-Commander-Stable

Malware Suite/Menu designed for "Speedy and No-Mistakes Penetration Testing", written in Python 2.7.13 and tested on Kali Linux 4.6. Requires Python 2.7 + Pip + Termcolor Module. All code is entirely free to be used in your own projects.

# Update: Explanation for my Absence, June 28th, 2017, Scheduled Return, AFTER July 7th, 2017

Since Late May, my updates have been far more infrequent. Due to the stresses of my summer tax class, Federal Taxation, as well as the terms of my probation (yes I been convicted of a crime, act of violence kind of deal).

My last exam is on July 7th. Until that date, I wouldn't expect much updates to be done to the Arms-Commander Project, or it's offshoots, Cylon-Raider, and "PMP" or Python-Mirai Project.

**I will return to coding and adding more features to AC, AFTER July 7th**. Until that date, I do not have any time to invest. However, you may find infrequent updates to my other project, meant for my fellow tax class students: https://github.com/tanc7/ACC_410_Tax_Calculator_Project

At least, I have 2 B's on my first two Exams! Which is very abnormal for a student in that class. Even better, I went partying for three days at Electric Daisy Carnival, and I still managed to get 3% higher WITHOUT using the tax calculator software that I made. And the people around me are getting D and F averages lol!

Anywho, until I finish this class, and it is imperative that I do so (it's my "last chance to pass out of 3 withdrawals/drops/fails"), I will not be able to reliably provide support for Arms-Commander. Meanwhile, I will have to pass one more class, Accounting 402, Financial Reporting II in the Fall and complete my terms of probation. 

# Update: Counter-Forensics Suite, Top Metasploit Plugins, TSOCKS. and more!

For the most part this update is another back-end upgrade. However, visually for the user they may notice a few key differences

	1. TSocks (Tor-Socks) now auto-installed as a alternative to using and configuring proxychains, simply preclude your command with "tsocks <cmd>" to automatically route your traffic through Tor, like 'tsocks nmap <target>'"
	2. Fail2Ban is recognized as a critical component for remote servers in the cloud, due to near-constant SSH brute-forcing attempts, and is now automatically installed and auto-configured
	3. A bug has been fixed where hashcat utilities failed to download and install. It is now automatically performed through the setup.py file, simply type "python setup.py"
	4. The Metasploit Plugins suite from DarkOperator on GitHub is now automatically installed and dropped into your metasploit installation, to use, type 'load pentest' in msfconsole and type 'help' to see a list of commands on the top.
	5. Mass-mailer attacks are recognized as a crucial method in getting reverse shells to open, this current AC installation includes a Python HTML mass-mailer installation (go to the menu and type INSTALL)
	6. There are multiple un-implemented modules to Cylon-Raider & Raider-Lite, as a result of the failed Missile-Lock Project. You can fiddle with them as you wish. 


As usual, the dev for ArmsCommander rigorously tests his modules before ever releasing it. However, some bugs make it through and he will jump on it immediately if he sees one.

# COMMENCEMENT OF THE PYTHON-MIRAI PROJECT

After realizing that there is no Pythonic adaption of the open source Mirai Botnet source code, I have decided to begin a long-term reverse engineering project, to translate or convert all of the Mirai Botnet Source Code into Python.

This will take significantly longer than usual for me to stay updated on, readers may follow my notes here on what I found out about how Mirai works: https://github.com/tanc7/Arms-Commander/blob/master/remoteexploits/Mirai_Python_Project/notes.md

# Installation

Instead of fiddling with uncertain terminal commands, for those new Linux users, you can now simply download ONE FILE and run that to automate the setup harmlessly.

    just run 'python setup.py' in /$PATH/Arms-Commander

	1. Download "setup.py" which is the Experimental Arms-Commander Python Installer.
	2. Run the script, type 'python setup.py'
	3. It will automate the Git Cloning process for you as well as the git submodule inits and updating and python module installations
	4. It will also warn you to back up the log files provided by previous installs of Arms-Commander. You will have to type "CONTINUE" in all caps and hit [Enter] to proceed with replacing the old AC with the new AC
	5. As soon as it is done installing the prerequisites, it will automatically start ArmsCommander's Console. At this point you can start AC with the terminal command 'ArmsCommander.py' or double click the launcher on your /root/Desktop directory.

# Important Disclaimer about CUDA Setup Utility

Because of the

    proprietary factor of NVIDIA graphics drivers

    The volatile environment of buggy updates between all Linux and derivatives

    Various adaptions and buggy code in Arms-Commander that i am trying to fix as one person

    And that no one's machine is exactly alike (different drivers working for different NVIDIA models, breaking others, maybe requiring alternative desktop environments like XFCE for certain installations)

Its safe to assume that this utility can regularly break your machine.

What it does do, is attempt to automate the basic meat and potatoes of the NVIDIA driver installation process for Linux.

Technical support is lacking and incomplete.

You are in very dark waters, be warned.

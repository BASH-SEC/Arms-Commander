 # Overview

All code is free to fork and use as your own under the GNU "copyleft" license.

This includes any and all incorporated projects from other projects "touched" by Arms-Commander. Such Â as but not limited to, "Cylon-Raider", Cylon-Raider-Lite, Dont Patch Me Bro: (, and Chair Force, among others.

In truth, most of the code has been imported, or interacts with AC and therefore is subject to the proprietary software legislation of others. Only a small fraction of the utilities in AC were actually written by me.

# Waiver of Liability for Damages, Criminal Acts, Arrests, and Damages resultant from the use of this software.

By downloading and installing Arms-Commander, you hereby waive all of my involvement, responsibility, association, and collusion to any future criminal acts or civil offenses that are listed by, but not restricted to, Chapter 18 of the United States Code, Subsection 1030, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

This applies to both criminal and civil offenses within the jurisdiction of the United States. Including on the deck of a aircraft carrier (which is floating US Territory).

I am well aware of the "destructiveness" that AC, and all of its imported and derivative works could cause, particularly for spearphishing and "wardriving". For example, "CornHarvester", despite the title's claim as a "mass email harvester" for "spearphishing purposes", shall NOT be used to reflect blame or implicate the true owner behind this GitHub account.

Misuse of this and related repositories does NOT constitute association, collusion, or conspiracy.

 # Overview

All code is free to fork and use as your own under the GNU "copyleft" license.

This includes any and all incorporated projects from other projects "touched" by Arms-Commander. 

In truth, most of the code has been imported, or interacts with AC and therefore is subject to the proprietary software legislation of others. Only a small fraction of the utilities in AC were actually written by me.

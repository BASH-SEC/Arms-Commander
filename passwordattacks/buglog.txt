FIXED: Selecting Option #5 "Inter-Cat", gives a incorrectly ordered user input prompt. "Enter the FULL PATH to your PASSWORD DICTIONARY FILE: "

FIXED: Hybrid and Reverse-Hybrid Attacks

**BUGGED: "Mask-Attack" or "Brute-Force" syntax is bugged. Reading the manual on hashcat right now**

Okay... so they use a lot of fancy terms to describe something simple, for example "optparse" but for hashcat to properly use a character set you can either use "-1" or full length wise... "--custom-charset1=CS"

And....

"-1 charsets/special/Russian/ru_ISO-8859-5-special.hcchr"

Just means

"--custom-charset1=CS charsets/special/Russian/ru_ISO-8859-5-special.hcchr"

Which is located in this folder: /usr/share/hashcat/charsets/

So I am guessing this is how its supposed to be done

"hashcat -a 3 <charset switch> <charset hcchr file> <password length>"

so if you type '?l' 5-times for password length, it means the password is five-letters long, and letters ONLY. To include numbers its 

"hashcat -a 3 <charset switch> <charset hcchr file> <number switch> <password length>"

Where number switch = '?l?d'

But you see, WPA2-PSK by itself, requires the user to have EIGHT characters at a minimum. So we should start the menu at that. However, I am not gonna just number that to the maximum bits. I'd rather have the user input it themselves.

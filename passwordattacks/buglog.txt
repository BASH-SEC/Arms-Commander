FIXED: Selecting Option #5 "Inter-Cat", gives a incorrectly ordered user input prompt. "Enter the FULL PATH to your PASSWORD DICTIONARY FILE: "

FIXED: Hybrid and Reverse-Hybrid Attacks

**BUGGED: "Mask-Attack" or "Brute-Force" syntax is bugged. Reading the manual on hashcat right now**

Okay... so they use a lot of fancy terms to describe something simple, for example "optparse" but for hashcat to properly use a character set you can either use "-1" or full length wise... "--custom-charset1=CS"

And....

"-1 charsets/special/Russian/ru_ISO-8859-5-special.hcchr"

Just means

"--custom-charset1=CS charsets/special/Russian/ru_ISO-8859-5-special.hcchr"

Which is located in this folder: /usr/share/hashcat/charsets/

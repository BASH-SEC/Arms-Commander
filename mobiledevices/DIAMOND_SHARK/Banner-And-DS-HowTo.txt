Diamond Shark, is the interactive menu for JDuck's exploit code of the Stagefright exploit:
https://github.com/jduck/cve-2015-1538-1

All you need to know is your victim's phone number and cell phone carrier, because MMS text messages are sent like email.

If your phone number is...

"310-123-4567"

And you use T-Mobile then your MMS address (or victim's) will be:

"13101234567@tmomail.net"

For your listener you need to use Metasploit's exploit/android/browser/stagefright_mp4_tx3g_64bit exploit
Upon generating a payload, a resource file will be made in your ArmsCommander Directory so you can quickly load up Metasploit and start up your listener

The author of the code claims that it only has been tested on a Android 4.0 Galaxy Nexus Device, but it also worked on my HTC One M8 running Android 6.0

Just Press 1 to see all possible Phone Number + Carrier Domain ("Email Address") Combos
Just Press 2 to generate a payload by entering LHOST, LPORT, and desired output filename

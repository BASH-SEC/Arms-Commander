DISCLAIMER:

Grab yourself a cup of coffee after you start this.

It is going to TAKE A WHILE.

What "tester.py" does, is generate a payload in every possible combination of the following available types (that you will test yourself to verify that it works)
And then place it into your /root/ArmsCommander/payloads/tester directory

All you need to enter is

                                      #1 LHOST
                                      #2 LPORT

Whats the point of this? Well, since it's already configured to "randomize hashes", you should be able to VT-check the entire directory and verify whether or not the payloads are detectable.
DO NOT SUBMIT ACTUAL SAMPLES TO VIRUS TOTALS.

Furthermore, this helps you narrow-down which payloads may work best with a particular operating system.

The payloads generated are neatly named as so in the filename

                                      "client_linux_x64_http.exe"

                                      #1 format
                                      #2 Operating system
                                      #3 Architecture
                                      #4 Transport Method (SSL? HTTP?)
                                      #5 File Extension

The cool thing about Pupy, is that aside from "Transport Protocol", you don't have to specify a specific payload in Pupy's server (unlike Metasploit). You just...

                                      1. Start a server session and test all SSL payloads
                                      2. Restart your server And then the HTTP payloads
                                      3. And so on....

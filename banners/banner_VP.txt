WARNING:

Under no circumstances should you be "inspired" or "motivated" to carry out the cyberattacks documented
in the book Violent Python.

The people that have been incarcerated for the criminal acts that are being reenacted in the book,
have done SERIOUS TIME as a result of their choices. In some cases, they have acted as foreign enemy combatants,
international fugitives, and domestic terrorists. The stereotype of the "awkward but honest/noble Revenge of the Nerds Outcast" died
decades ago. Nowadays, there are some seriously bad actors that are exploiting technology as we speak (ISIS fighters
mounting grenades onto little AR Parrot Drones in Iraq.)

The author of this "Malware Suite", Chang Tan Lister, claims no responsibility for the actions that you may be charged for.
As the intent was to write AC for academic purposes only.

With a bit of modification some of the less viable or ("up-to-date") cyberattacks can be adapted to cause serious damage.

Cybercrimes, unless otherwise specified in detail under local and state law, are almost always considered to be
Federal Level Offense, by which you must serve 85% of your sentence before consideration of parole.

Chapter 18 of the United States Code, Subsection 1030 covers a MAJORITY of the offenses that may be charged against you
if suspected and convicted of cybercrimes, but it is by no means a definite interpretation of the law.

TLDR. "Retain a good lawyer".
